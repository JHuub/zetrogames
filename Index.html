<h1>[zetrogames.com] has been moved to a Google Sites to avoid the DODEA domain ban.</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Note: We are trying to submit a claim to unban the domain from DODEA's current web blocker [LightSpeed]. Hopefully we will have this educational website back up and running on our normal servers soon. I admit it is my fault for naming this website as such and wrongfully tripping the LightSpeed blocker. - @Jhub</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>For now feel free to check out the new site!</p>
